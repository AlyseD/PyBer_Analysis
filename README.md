# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
This analysis takes a look at ride-sharing data and seeks to gain trends into 3 main types of areas- urban, suburban and rural areas. Specifically, we look at the total number of rides, drivers, and fares, as well as the average fares per ride and driver. Using this information, we'll hope to find some trends and information to help make strategic business decisions about how to allocate resources and investments.

## Results
Results show that the urban areas have the highest volume of all values, includng total rides, drivers, fares and the average fares per driver and ride. During the winter months, there is a slightly steady upward trend of weekly fares in urban areas, whereas suburban and rural area prices fluctuate a bit more during that time period (at least for 2019). However, for all areas, there seem to be dips in fares starting towards the end of February. Suburban area prices tend to increase during April, but it is a slightly downward trend in rural areas and plateaus more in urban areas. However, as this is only a snapshot of a few months in one year, this may not be indicative of general patterns over a long period of time.


## Summary
The urban areas generate the most amount from fares than suburban and rural. One recommendation based solely on this data would be to try and recruit more urban drivers. However, there is still a lot of information that is unknown. A couple of recommendations would be to analyze the cost/overhead per driver in each city type - if urban drivers have more overhead (i.e., more liabilities for accidents, etc)- then it makes sense to find ways to recruit more suburban drivers. Using this information, a third recommendation would be to analyze the profit margins for each type to determine if the disparities from this chart coincide with margin trends as well. You could also use more data to analyze the weekly fares, as this graph only shows fares for Jan - April of a particular year.
